Check yourself before you wreck yourself.

A small Rust utility library inspired by the ideas of "Parse, don't validate"<sup>[1]</sup> and its follow-up, "Names are not type safety"<sup>[2]</sup>.
Its goal is to extend the idea to checking invariants more generally.
See [the crate documentation](https://docs.rs/check_mate) for more information.
